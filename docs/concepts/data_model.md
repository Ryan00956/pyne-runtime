# Data Model

Pyne accepts OHLCV bars:

```python
{
    "time": 1710000000,
    "open": 100.0,
    "high": 102.0,
    "low": 99.0,
    "close": 101.0,
    "volume": 1200.0,
    "time_close": 1710000060,
    "session_ismarket": True,
    "session_isfirstbar": False,
    "session_islastbar": False,
}
```

Rules:

- `time` is a Unix timestamp in seconds.
- `time_close` is optional. When omitted, batch scripts infer it from the next bar's `time`; the final bar remains `na`.
- Price and volume fields are converted to floats.
- `session_ismarket`, `session_isfirstbar`, and `session_islastbar` are optional
  host-provided session flags used by the script-level `session.*` namespace.
  A nested `session` dict with `ismarket`, `isfirstbar`, and `islastbar` is also
  accepted.
- Data should be sorted by time before it is passed to Pyne.
- Hosts are responsible for adapting exchange/database formats into this contract.

`PyneData` is a lightweight wrapper around this standard shape.
